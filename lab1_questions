direction - basicall if the gpio pin is set for input or output
	If the output driver is enabled or not determines if it is set for output or input. 
	1 = output, 0 = input 
9.8 - pg. 597 

3.1.11 - pg. 54 is a list of registers.
	has the functions that change GPIO_OE_* that change the "direction" of the GPIO pin

from question 1 set OE to 0 to make the pins an input (GPIO_OE_CLR)

since GP21 and GP26 are below 32 we used the low GPIO registers
	GPIO_OE_CLR
	(not the high one)

so I think that mask is just a variable (represents a bit mask)

1 << 21 means start with a binary number 1 and then shift 21 times. Thus making a binary 21. 
mask = (1 << 21) | (1 <<26);

section 9.8 pg. 597
section 3.3.11 -- this list of SIO registers

To check direction we must read the GPIO_OE value. 

GPIO_OE_SET
AND
GPIO_OE_CLR
are write only. They only store bits they don't write them 

We check the GPIO_OE (pins 0-31) AND GPIO_HI_OE (pins 32-47)

to check make a variable that is true for the register you want to check. 
Then make another that is set to the gpio output from the sio hardware register.
Use boolean expression to compare them

gpio_values = sio_hw->gpio_oe
test_register = 1 << 21
is_output = gpio_values != 0;
is_input = gpio_values != 1;
//have to use != because c will return true for any non value while == will compare the entire number I think.

So the "value" is the actually logic value (voltage) of the pin

gpio_out_set
gpio_out_clr
gpio_hi_out_set
gpio_hi_out_clr

gpio_out_set / gpio_out_clr will set the out value of gpio register pins 0 - 31 to logic high or low.

sio_hw->gpio_out_set = (1 << 21);
//will set gpio pin 21 to output high

5.

gpio_in
gpio_hi_in

these read what logic level is being input at the pin while the out is the logic level being output by the pin. 

in 3.1.11 it states that these allow the processor to sample the current state of the gpio's
